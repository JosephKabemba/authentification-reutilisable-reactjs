CORS: A security feature that is implemented inside the web browser and that behaviour cannot be overriden.
      Browser(Preflight request) : Hey API i've got a JS script from xyz.com and it seems risky,is it OK if i'm making request from xyz.com to you as mybank.com in a different domain?
      API : Hi Browser,it's only oky if you make this request from mybank.com domaine
      Browser : Thanks API.Script you cannot make this request to a different domaine

      By default express server is configured to allows cors requests if it has a different port even if it the same domaine.
      If domain,subdomain or port are different the browser applies this security rule
